A quick boilerplate framework for fontcustom to make font integration with your project more seamless

A preview/reference page is forthcoming, but the repo as it stands is pretty much all you need to inject fontcustom into your SASS project. I might add support for less at some point, but for now there's more on my roadmap than dealing with that. 

Usage
=====

I haven't had a chance to write helpful docs yet, but the main points to know are:
- You'll need to install [font custom](http://fontcustom.com/)
- Run `fontcustom compile` from `/in`\*
- You can symlink to `/out/sass/templates`\* to include the compiled `.sass` files in your framework
- A JSON array of all icon classnames is created in `/out/templates/icon-array.json`\*
- You can make your own custom templates in `/in/templates`â€”just add a compile output path in fontcustom.yml
- And you can change the font-face name/classname prefix for your font name/icon classnames in `in/fontcustom.yml`

\* I know it's counterintuitive, but that's the way things are until [this bug](https://github.com/FontCustom/fontcustom/issues/195#issuecomment-38879690) gets fixed y'dig?
